	Abstract = { Known attempts to build autonomous robots rely on complex control architectures, usually implemented with the Robot Operating System (ROS). Runtime adaptation is needed in these systems, to cope with component failures and with contingencies arising from dynamic environments -- otherwise these affect the reliability and quality of the mission execution. Existing proposals on how to build self-adaptive systems in robotics usually require a major re-design of the control architecture and rely on complex tools unfamiliar to the robotics community. Moreover, they are hard to reuse across applications. This paper presents MROS: a model-based framework for runtime adaptation of robot control architectures based on ROS. MROS uses a combination of domain-specific languages to model architectural variants and capture mission quality concerns, and an ontology-based implementation of the MAPE-K and meta-control visions for runtime adaptation. The experiment results obtained applying MROS in two realistic ROS-based robotic demonstrators show the benefits of our approach in terms of the quality of the mission execution, and MROS's extensibility and reusability across robotic applications. },

	Abstract = {There is a growing demand for mobile robots to operate in more variable environments, where guaranteeing safe robot navigation is a priority, in addition to time performance. To achieve this, current solutions for local planning use a specific configuration tuned to the characteristics of the application en- vironment. In this paper, we present an approach for developing quality models that can be used by a self-adaptation framework to adapt the local planner configuration at run-time based on the perceived environment. We contribute a definition of safety model that predicts the safety of a navigation configuration given the perceived environment. Experiments have been performed in a realistic navigation scenario for a retail application to validate the obtained models and demonstrate their integration in a self- adaptation framework.},

	Abstract = {Without prior knowledge of the environment, a software agent can learn to achieve
a goal using machine learning. Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used
to make the agent explore the environment and learn to achieve its goal by trial and
error. Discovering effective policies to achieve the goal in a complex environment
is a major challenge for RL. Furthermore, in safety-critical applications, such as
robotics, an unsafe action may cause catastrophic consequences in the agent or in
the environment. In this paper, we present an approach that uses runtime monitoring
to prevent the reinforcement learning agent to perform "wrong" actions and to exploit
prior knowledge to smartly explore the environment. Each monitor is defined by a property
that we want to enforce to the agent and a context. The monitors are orchestrated
by a meta-monitor that activates and deactivates them dynamically according to the
context in which the agent is learning. We have evaluated our approach by training
the agent in randomly generated learning environments. Our results show that our approach
blocks the agent from performing dangerous and safety-critical actions in all the
generated environments. Besides, our approach helps the agent to achieve its goal
faster by providing feedback and shaping its reward during learning.},

@article{Aguado-2021,
	Abstract = {Autonomous systems are expected to maintain a dependable operation without human intervention. They are intended to fulfill the mission for which they were deployed, properly handling the disturbances that may affect them. Underwater robots, such as the UX-1 mine explorer developed in the UNEXMIN project, are paradigmatic examples of this need. Underwater robots are affected by both external and internal disturbances that hamper their capability for autonomous operation. Long-term autonomy requires not only the capability of perceiving and properly acting in open environments but also a sufficient degree of robustness and resilience so as to maintain and recover the operational functionality of the system when disturbed by unexpected events. In this article, we analyze the operational conditions for autonomous underwater robots with a special emphasis on the UX-1 miner explorer. We then describe a knowledge-based self-awareness and metacontrol subsystem that enables the autonomous reconfiguration of the robot subsystems to keep mission-oriented capability. This resilience augmenting solution is based on the deep modeling of the functional architecture of the autonomous robot in combination with ontological reasoning to allow self-diagnosis and reconfiguration during operation. This mechanism can transparently use robot functional redundancy to ensure mission satisfaction, even in the presence of faults.},

@article{Hernandez-2018,
	Abstract = {This article describes Team Delft's robot winning the Amazon Robotics Challenge 2016. The competition involves automating pick and place operations in semi-structured environments, specifically the shelves in an Amazon warehouse. Team Delft's entry demonstrated that current robot technology can already address most of the challenges in product handling: object recognition, grasping, motion, or task planning; under broad yet bounded conditions. The system combines an industrial robot arm, 3D cameras and a custom gripper. The robot's software is based on the Robot Operating System to implement solutions based on deep learning and other state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques, and to integrate them with off- the-shelf components. From the experience developing the robotic system it was concluded that: 1) the specific task conditions should guide the selection of the solution for each capability required, 2) understanding the characteristics of the individual solutions and the assumptions they embed is critical to integrate a performing system from them, and 3) this characterization can be based on 'robot automation' levels. This paper proposes automation levels based on the usage of information at design or runtime to drive the robot's behaviour, and uses them to discuss Team Delft's design solution and the lessons learned from this robot development experience.},

	Abstract = {Cognitive systems are starting to be deployed as appliances across the technological landscape of modern societies. The increasing availability of high performance computing platforms has opened an opportunity for statistics-based cognitive systems that perform quite as humans in certain tasks that resisted the symbolic methods of classic artificial intelligence. Cognitive artefacts appear every day in the media, raising a wave of mild fear concerning artificial intelligence and its impact on society. These systems, performance notwithstanding, are quite brittle and their reduced dependability limips their potential for massive deployment in mission-critical applications -e.g. in autonomous driving or medical diagnosis. In this paper we explore the actual possibility of building cognitive systems using engineering-grade methods that can assure the satisfaction of strict requirements for their operation. The final conclusion will be that, besides the potential improvement provided by a rigorous engineering process, we are still in need of a solid theory -possibly the main outcome of cognitive science- that could sustain such endeavour. In this sense, we propose the use of formal ontologies as backbones of cognitive systems engineering processes and workflows.},

	Abstract = {Our research focuses on engineering processes for autonomous intelligent systems construction with a life-cycle holistic view, by means of a model-based framework. The conceptual core of the framework is ontologically-driven. Our ontological approach consists of two elements. The first one is a domain Ontology for Autonomous Systems (OASys) to capture the autonomous system structure, function and behaviour. The second element is an Ontology-driven Engineering Methodology (ODEM) to develop the target autonomous system. This methodology is based on Model-based Systems Engineering and produces models of the system as core assets. These models are used through the whole system life-cycle, from implementation or validation to operation and maintenance. On the application side, the ontological framework has been used to develop a metacontrol engineering technology for autonomous systems, the OM Engineering Process (OMEP), to improve their runtime adaptivity and resilience. OMEP has been applied to a mobile robot in the form of a metacontroller built on top of the robot's control architecture. It exploits a functional model of the robot (TOMASys Model) to reconfigure its control if required by the situation at runtime. The functional model is based on a metamodel about controller function and structure using concepts form the ontology. The metacontroller was developed using the ontology-driven methodology and a robot control reference architecture.},

	Abstract = {There is an increasing demand for more autonomous systems. Enhancing systems with self-aware and self- adaptation capabilities can provide a solution to meet resilience needs. This article proposes a general design solution to build autonomous systems capable of run-time reconfiguration. The solution leverages Model-Driven Engineering with Model-Based Cognitive Control. The key idea is the integration of a metacontroller in the control architecture of the autonomous system, capable of perceiving the dysfunctional components of the control system and reconfiguring it, if necessary, at runtime. At the core of the metacontroller's operation lies a model of the system's functional architecture, which can be generated from the engineering modeling of the system.},
