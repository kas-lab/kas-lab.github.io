## KAS lab Mission
### What
We develop novel methods in knowledge representation and reasoning for autonomous systems to use **engineering sense**

### How
- Exploring **model-based systems engineering** methods to design and model the architectures for robotic systems.
- Developing new applications of **KRR methods** to drive adaptation and explainability in AI-based robotic systems at runtime.
- Integrating **data-driven methods** to address _uncertainty_ in robotic systems.

### Who
Our methods will help roboticist develop more **reliable**, **trustworthy** and **explainable** robots.
